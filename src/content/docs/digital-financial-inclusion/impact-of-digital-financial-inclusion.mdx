Let’s explore the different levels of impact by following the stories of three individuals. These stories are based on the problems and challenges of real individuals.

## Individuals

Our first individual is an indigenous/rural community member without easy access to banks. The banks that do exist aren’t local and would charge significant fees for this individual to use their services, preventing her from participating.

Her biggest concerns are finding ways to pay for basic items and receive payments without paying the fees that banks require. She has family in other countries who want to send her remittances, but she can’t receive those payments.

  She is most excited by being able to accumulate the wealth needed to grow
  herself and her community, but can’t see how to get there without being
  included in the digital financial system. With an easy digital solution, she
  can receive and use remittance payments, while also managing her expenses
  easier and cheaper.

## Businesses

Our second individual is a small business owner in a region that lacks sufficient digital infrastructure. He has a profitable business, predominantly on a local level.

To run his business, he needs certain supplies not readily available in his home country.

They are available in a nearby country, but there are no good financial pathways for exchanging money between his country and the nearby country.

  He would want to have an easy, digital way to connect to suppliers in other
  countries. Currently, he has to travel to other countries with cash and deal
  with local banks to get non-optimal exchange rates that have daily limits.
  Thus, he must stay a week at a time to be able to transfer the money needed to
  buy his supplies. He is most excited by being able to run his business more
  efficiently and effectively, and possibly expand his business.

## Local economies

Our third individual is a government worker who needs to set policy and direct local funding for her country. Her goal is to ensure that more of her country’s population participates in the formal economy.

Her concern is that there are inter-related technical, legal and social problems, and that available solutions are complex to develop and implement.

  If she can bring more individuals into the the formal economy, those
  individuals will have more reliable and safe access to the finances needed to
  run their lives. Additionally, the government would save a significant amount
  of resources if the economy became more digital and less cash-based.
