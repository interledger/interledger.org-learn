The [Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org/) (ILF) was established in 2020 as a US-based 501(c)3 grantmaking organization. Our aim is to increase access to digital financial services by advocating for the adoption of the open-payment network, [Interledger](https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/interledger-protocol/), and working directly with historically marginalized groups.

We work with a global community of people who have a shared aim to make digital financial services accessible through open source technology.
