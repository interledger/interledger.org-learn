The [Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org/) (ILF) was established in 2020 as a US-based 501(c)3 grantmaking organization. Our aim is to increase access to digital financial services by advocating for the adoption of the open-payment network, [Interledger](https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/interledger-protocol/), and working directly with historically marginalized groups.

We work with a global community of people who have a shared aim to make digital financial services accessible through open source technology.

## Our vision

### Send a payment as easily as an email

The Interledger Protocol (ILP) eases the friction of digital payments as it provides a bridge for closed networks to transact with each other in ways that are more accessible, efficient, and less costly. This means transactions are not limited to particular banks, mobile money providers, or even borders.

## Our mission

### Build equity and inclusion within Interledger

We advance our mandate through mission-aligned awards for entrepreneurs, organizations, and government agencies who are from or working with historically marginalized communities.

Our core focus is: Research | Education | Financial Services | Ambassadorships

## Our values

### Be Open. Be Inclusive. Be Innovative.

Our technology will always be open, accessible, and shared with the global community of payment advocates and architects.

It’s a considerable mission to bring the most vulnerable populations into the digital financial ecosystem. Working within communities and with a range of stakeholders is essential to make this dream a reality.

Shaking up the status quo will not happen with the same tried and tired solutions. Fresh perspectives and creative thought partnership is not only welcomed and encouraged, but necessary.

## Our technology

### Unlocking Payment Potential

Our role is to advocate the benefits of interoperability and inclusivity in digital payment networks, build a strong and sustainable open-source community, and be the neutral home of Interledger Protocol (ILP) and it’s associated standards, patents and trademarks.

The Interledger Protocol (ILP) was created in 2015 by Stefan Thomas and Evan Schwartz. It routes packets of value across the Interledger network just as TCP/IP routes packets of information across the internet. By moving value as seamlessly as the internet moves information, payments set up using ILP are secure, fast, and can be in any currency, including fiat or otherwise. This means transactions are not limited to particular banks, mobile money providers, or even borders.

The Open Payments standard, which supports Interledger as a payment method, allows organizations to build interoperable payment services easier and join the Interledger network faster. This helps more people access digital financial services - and supports the 1.4 billion people who are currently excluded.
