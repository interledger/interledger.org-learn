The Interledger Protocol is actually divided into 5 layers. Each layer serves a particular role. The top layers are higher level and increasingly about the system as a whole, and the lower levels are more granular. We can explain each of these layers with an analogy to the post office.

The top four ILP layers also mimic the four layers of the internet's TCP/IP protocol.

More info is available in the [technical documentation](https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/interledger-architecture/).
