The Interledger Protocol is actually divided into 5 layers. Each layer serves a particular role. The top layers are higher level and increasingly about the system as a whole, and the lower levels are more granular. We can explain each of these layers with an analogy to the post office.

The top 4 ILP layers also mimic the 4 layers of the TCP/IP, more info in the [technical documentation](https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/interledger-architecture/).
