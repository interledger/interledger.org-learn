:::tip[Your Turn: Transfer Some Money]

You will now transfer (test) money using a very real test wallet that uses ILP. Follow the steps on the slides to set up an account and discover how easy ILP is to use when embedded in a Rafiki instance using Open Payments.

:::

## Step 1 - Get an Interledger test wallet

Go to the Interledger test wallet and make an account: https://rafiki.money/

1. Click to create an account.
2. Verify your email.
3. Login with the credentials you set up.

_Note that this is a test account. This step needs your real email account, but no steps after this will require any personal information- the steps are kept in place so that you can see the kind of information required were this to be used in a real-world setting._

## Step 2a - Complete KYC

1. After first log in, you should be taken to a form which to fill in your personal details. Keep all the prefilled info as is, just enter your first and last name.
2. Click "Get Wallet Account".

## Step 2b - Complete KYC

In a real-world scenario, you would upload a document so your identity could be verified. For now, keep the defaults and click Verify Account.

## Step 3 - Open an account

Congrats! You should now be on the home screen. The next step is to open an account.

1. Click “Create Account”.
2. Give the account whatever name you’d like.
3. Choose the currency the account will support.

## Step 4a - Set up the account

1. Click into your new account.
2. Click Add Payment Pointer. The Create Payment Pointer screen appears.

A payment pointer is a wallet address that’s specific to Interledger. You’ll use the payment pointer when sending and receiving payments via Open Payments.

## Step 4b - Set up the account

Now, click Add Money. The Add Money to Account screen appears. Add any amount. Since this is test money, you can add as much or as little as needed for testing purposes (this step would of course operate much differently in a real-world situation).

## Step 5 - Buy something from the test store

Now that you have set up an account, you can buy something from a test store we have set up that operates on the same Interledger network as the test wallet.

1. Go to https://rafiki.boutique/products.
2. Add something to your cart.
3. View your shopping cart, then click Checkout.
4. Select Open Payments as your payment method, then enter your payment pointer.
5. You should then see a popup asking you to approve the transaction. If you don’t see the popup, make sure you are making the purchase on the same browser that you are logged into your account.

## Step 6 - Send proof of purchase

Last step! Find proof of your purchase and upload it to Slack!

Go back to your Interledger test wallet account and open your “Transactions” page. Take a screenshot of that page showing your successful transaction and upload it to the Slack channel.

_If the transaction doesn’t seem to be going through, ensure you have enough test money in your account to make the purchase._
