<Aside type="tip" title="Your Turn: Transfer Some Money">

The Interledger test network, which uses ILP, Rafiki, and Open Payments, allows you to sign up for a wallet and transfer (test) money.

Follow the steps below to set up an account and discover how easy ILP is to use.

</Aside>

## Step 1 - Get an Interledger test wallet

Go to the Interledger test wallet site and make an account: https://rafiki.money/

1. Click to create an account.
2. Verify your email.
3. Log in with the credentials you set up.

_Note that this is a test account. This step needs your real email address, but no steps after this will require any personal information. The steps are kept in place so that you can see the kind of information required were this to be used in a real-world setting._

  ></iframe>
</div>

## Step 2a - Complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) process

1. After first log in, you are taken to a form requesting your personal details. Enter your first and last name. Keep the remaining prefilled fields as they are.
2. Click **Get Wallet Account**.

## Step 2b - Complete KYC

In a real-world scenario, you would upload a document so your identity could be verified. For now, keep the defaults and click **Verify Account**.

## Step 3 - Open a wallet account

Congrats! You should now be on the home screen. The next step is to open a wallet account.

1. Click **New Account**.
2. Give the account whatever name you’d like.
3. Choose the currency (asset) the account will support.
4. Click **Create Account**.

## Step 4 - Set up your wallet address

1. Click into your new account.
2. Click **Add Payment Pointer**. The _Create Payment Pointer_ screen appears

:::note[Payment pointers]

A payment pointer is a wallet address that’s specific to Interledger. You’ll use the payment pointer when sending and receiving payments via Open Payments.

:::

3. Fill out the _Payment Pointer name_ and _Public name_ fields with any value.
4. Click **Create**.

## Step 5 - Add money to your wallet

1. Click **Add Money**. The _Add Money to Account_ screen appears.
2. Enter any amount. Since this isn't real money, you can add as much or as little as needed for testing purposes (this step would of course operate much differently in a real-world situation).
3. Click **Add Money**.

## Step 6 - Make a purchase

Now that you've set up a wallet account, you can buy something from Interledger Boutique, our test store. Interledger Boutique operates on the same Interledger network as the test wallet.

1. Go to https://rafiki.boutique/products.
2. Add something to your cart.
3. View your shopping cart, then click **Checkout**.
4. Select Open Payments as your payment method, then enter your payment pointer.
5. Click **Pay**.

You should receive a popup asking you to approve the transaction. If you don’t see the popup:

- Check your popup blocker
- Ensure you're making the purchase on the same browser that's logged into your wallet account

## Step 7 - Show proof of purchase

1. Go back into your Interledger test wallet account.
2. Click **Transactions** in the left sidebar.
3. Take a screenshot of your successful transaction.

_If the transaction doesn’t seem to be going through, ensure you have enough test money in your account to make the purchase._

:::tip[Upload proof of purchase]

In the [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T0KKJC1N1/C06MAS29NF4), type `TBD`, then upload your screenshot.
