:::tip[Your Turn: Share What You Learned]

In the [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T0KKJC1N1/C06MAS29NF4), type `TBD`.

Tell us about something new and valuable you learned that you will take with you going forward. This can be either in your future work with Interledger, or elsewhere. You can draw from the Interledger principles, examples from this unit, or examples from any other part of the course.

Let us know what you learned, and how you will use it!
