:::tip[Your Turn: Share What You Learned]

Drawing from the Interledger principles or examples from this unit, or from any other part of the course, tell us about something new and valuable you learned that you will take with you going forward. This can be either in your future work with Interledger, or elsewhere.

Let us know what you learned, and how you will use it!
