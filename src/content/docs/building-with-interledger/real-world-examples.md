Now let’s take some time to hear from some real members of the community on how they have used ILP to solve real problems that they face. Watch these two videos of each community member describing a problem in their terms.

## The People’s Clearinghouse

The People’s Clearinghouse solution really embodies the Interledger principles. Their solution is directly about building digital infrastructure in a region. **Interoperability** both between multiple local banks as well as between countries (the USA and Mexico) are top of mind for them, and their solution will make use of **open payments** and **open standards**.

In the [Digital Financial Inclusion unit](/digital-financial-inclusion/what-is-digital-financial-inclusion/), you’ll find many parallels between the individual and local economy stories and The People’s Clearinghouse challenge.

## Wallet Guru

Wallet Guru’s solution of Paystreme is a good example of an **interoperable** digital wallet that achieves its success through the use of **open payments** and **open standards** that intersects with one of the critical services in the region, utility companies.

In the [Digital Financial Inclusion unit](/digital-financial-inclusion/what-is-digital-financial-inclusion/), you’ll find a lot of parallels between the businesses and local economy stories, and Wallet Guru’s challenge.
